<title>Security Considerations</title>

<para>
The simplest and most common way of deploying &slony1; is to create a
son database user account on all nodes in the system and give that
account database superuser privileges.  This allows &slony1; to do 
anything it needs.

The minimum privileges for running each component of &slony1; are:
<sect3><title>Slonik</title>
<para>
The slonik admin connections need to connect to the database as a database
superuser.  As part of the installation of &slony1;, the slonik program will
create C language functions in the database.  This requires superuser
access.  Some slonik commands will enable and disable indicies which by
manipulating pg_class.  This also requires superuser access.

<title>Slon Local Connection<title>
<para>
Each slon instance has a 'local' database connection.  This is the database
connection that is specified on the either the slon command line or the
slon configuration file.  Slon needs to connect to this database as a 
superuser.  In particular slon needs to have sufficient permissions to:

<title>Slon Remote Connections</title>
<para>
The Remote slon connection information is specified in the 
<xref linkend="stmtstorepath"> command when adding paths.  The slon
daemon needs to connect to remote databases with sufficient permissions 
to:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Read (query) the sl_event tables</para>
<listitem><para> Read (query) the sl_log_1 and sl_log_2 tables</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> Read (query) any replicated tables that originate on the
remote  node.  This is done as part of the initial COPY during the 
subscription process</para></listitem>
