To run &slony1;  you will need

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>&postgres; 8.3 or above (this version of &slony1; is 
known to work with 8.3.x, 8.4.x and 9.0.x). Earlier versions of &postgres;
require &slony; 1.2.x </para></listitem>

The following are recommended for running &slony1;

<listitem><para>A method of keeping the clocks on your replicas
reasonably in sync such as NTP</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>A reliable network between nodes</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>All of your databases should be using the same

<title>Requirements for compiling &slony</title>

<para> In order to compile &slony1;, you need to have the following
tools:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para> GNU make.  Other make programs will not work.  GNU
make is often installed under the name <command>gmake</command>; this
document will therefore always refer to it by that name. (On
Linux-based systems GNU make is typically the default make, and is
called <command>make</command>) </para> </listitem>

<listitem><para> You need an ISO/ANSI C compiler.  Recent versions of
<application>GCC</application> work.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> You also need a recent version of &postgres;
including the server headers. You must have &postgres; version 8.3 
or newer to be able to build and use &slony1;.  </para>
